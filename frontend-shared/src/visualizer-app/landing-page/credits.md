**COSMOS** is an AI assistant that extracts and assimilates data from
heterogeneous sources to accelerate analytics and knowledge discovery.
It is the result of a collaboration between computer scientists specializing
in inference across noisy datasets and geoscientists interested in automated recall
of information from the scientific literature.

The [**COSMOS Visualizer**](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-visualizer)
application provides an interface to
training data, model components, and results for the
[**COSMOS** knowledge-base construction pipeline](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos),
which is backed by the UW-Madison xDD
([**GeoDeepDive**](https://geodeepdive.org/)) digital library and high-throughput
computing infrastructure.
Our software is released under an Apache License, Version 2.0.

<!--The [backend](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-result-visualizer) (
server, database, and
API) and
[UI components](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-visualizer-frontend)
are shared with our **Image Tagger** training-dataset
generation user interface.
The user interface components exposed here can be composed and reused
for other knowledge-base construction and introspection tasks. -->
