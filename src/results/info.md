This prototype web application contains model results for the **COSMOS**
knowledge-base extraction pipeline. The first interface covers
region-of-interest extractions and model entities (e.g. equations, variables in
text, and semantically associated phrases). The second allows searching by
entity type through a corpus of documents.
