### COSMOS Visualizer

The **COSMOS Visualizer** web application provides an interface to
model components and results for the **COSMOS** model.
The [backend](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-result-visualizer) (
server, database, and
API) and
[UI components](https://github.com/UW-COSMOS/cosmos-visualizer-frontend)
are shared with our **Image Tagger** training-dataset
generation user interface.
The user interface is composed of building
blocks designed for easy reuse for other knowledge-base construction and
introspection tasks.
